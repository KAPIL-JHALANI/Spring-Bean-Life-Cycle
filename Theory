@Postconstruct --> method call after the bean creation + dependency injection completed

@PreDestroy   --> method call just before bean or object is destroyed (If container is destroyed then first all it's beans are destroyed)

In Standalone application we need to clost the context manually to run the @predestroy method.
In web app we don't need to destro the cnotainer object. It automatically handles.

BEAN LIFE CYCLE FLOW:

Container started -> Bean Instantiated -> Dependency Injected ->  custom init method called (@postconstruct wala) -> Bean is ready to use ->
Container Shutdown -> Custom destroy method called (@predestroy wala  and this one is called just before the deletion or destroy of bean or congtainer) -> Stop
